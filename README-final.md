## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first project using HTML and CSS. I mostly utilized the Flexbox property to achieve the results I wanted. During this project I got the general feeling of using CSS in various ways.

I had some trouble with aligning the card section properly, but setting the display to flex solved that problem. After that, the challenge was easily solved.

### Continued development

In future projects I will focus more on various display styles, such as grid. 

### Useful resources

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) - The lessons in Codecademy helped me to understand the basics (and more) of CSS and HTML. I completed lessons here, took notes, then applied my learnings in this project.
